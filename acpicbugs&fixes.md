- Snackbar confirms upload even when pics are still uploading
- The upload history is not in cronological order (latest upload is in the middle)
- also in list I have "0 pictures uploaded"
- When clicking "select all" if the pics below the fold haven't loaded yet, they are not selected on the interface - the pics are do not have the blue dot and the blue color, even if the interface says they're selected. Is confusing for the user.
- If I select 2 pics (or more, does not matter) and then go to a different view ('upload'), when I go back, even after uploading pics, the same pics that were selected are still selected. Is it supposed to work that way? If so, why?
- Drop down menu, what is the 'upload' option for sorting pics? 
- The eye icon next to "View pictures" doen't do anything, yet is clickable. Is confusing.
- When searching for a tag, after I found what I want, unless I delete the search term, I can't navigate to anywhere else. Search should behave like clicking on a particular tag, meaning that then I can go back to the initial state when I eliminate that tag from the breadcrumb row, click on 'all pictures' or click on 'untagged'. 
- Also when searching, if I search for a tag that's not part of my current selection, nothing happens. Example: I'm in 'Japan' and search for "las vegas". Nothing happens. Not sure if we should override the current navigation with the search (ie: if I search Las Vegas, it clears the current navigation - it clears Japan - and returns the Las Vegas tag with all the possible intersecting tags), or expect that the search should be within the context of the current navigation (I can't search for Las Vegas while in Japan. If I'm in Japan I can only search for tags that have possible intersections with this tag). 
- Untagged: as soon as I put the first tag, the pic dissapears. I didn't have the chance to put a second tag. We should wait for the user to finish tagging.
