# ac;pic :: a home for your pictures

## About

ac;pic is an application that allows you to store and manage your pictures. ac;pic is built by [Altocode](https://altocode.nl). While the service itself is paid, Altocode freely shares the code for all purposes, including commercial ones.

To understand why we're sharing the source code of a commercial product, please read [our manifesto](http://federicopereiro.com/manifesto). If that's too long to read, in a nutshell: we want to share our code so that others can learn from it and contribute to us. Sharing is the way to progress.

All non-code documents related to the project are published in this [open folder](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/1/folders/11UPZHrHUT_ce2baN9s0K-CtfXYQOewG3).

## Status

The application is currently under development and has not been launched yet. We estimate to have an alpha by 2020.

The author wishes to thank [Browserstack](https://browserstack.com) for providing tools to test cross-browser compatibility.

### Todo alpha

- Client
   - New interface.

### Todo v1

- Migrate to gotoB v2
- return false on preventdefault?
- Add logic & endpoint to send to server latency of `query` requests.

- Server
   - httponly cookie & csrf token
   - Security: figure out if workaround for package-lock is necessary with nested dependencies that are not pegged.
   - ac;tools

- Admin & deploy
   - Manage payments.
   - Favicon & icons.
   - Report pictures.
   - Security writeup: xss routes with user input (tags, eventually picture titles; image contents are left to browsers but images have to be valid as per imagemagick), cookie as signed token, CSRF prevented by sending cookie (not by headers, https://blog.appsecco.com/exploiting-csrf-on-json-endpoints-with-flash-and-redirects-681d4ad6b31b), s3 encryption, we encrypt the cookie only for distinguishing expired cookie from attack (https://hueniverse.com/on-securing-web-session-ids-b90f566b3786)

## Routes

If any route fails with an internal error, a 500 code will be returned with body `{error: ...}`.

All `POST` requests must have a `content-type` header of `application/json` and their bodies must be valid JSON objects. The only exception is `POST /pic`, which must be of type `multipart/form-data`.

All non-auth routes (unless marked otherwise) will respond with a 403 error with body `{error: 'nocookie'}` if the user is not logged in.

If a cookie with invalid signature is sent along, the application will respond with a 403 error with body `{error: 'tampered'}`.

If a cookie with valid signature but that has already expired is sent along, the application will respond with a 403 error with body `{error: 'session'}`.

All POST requests (unless marked otherwise) must contain a `cookie` field equivalent to the `cookie` provided by a successfull call to `POST /auth/login`. This requirement is for CSRF prevention. In the case of `POST /upload`, the cookie must be present as a field within the `multipart/form-data` form. If this condition is not met, a 403 error will be sent.

### Request invite

- `POST /requestInvite`.
   - Body must be `{email: STRING}`, otherwise a 400 will be sent.

### Auth routes

- `POST /auth/login`.
   - Does not require the user to be logged in.
   - Body must be `{username: STRING, password: STRING, tz: INTEGER}`. If not, a 400 code will be returned with body `{error: ...}`.
   - `username` is lowercased and any leading & trailing space is removed from it (and intermediate spaces or space-like characters are reduced to a single space). `username` can be either the `username` or the `email` associated to a `username`.
   - If the username/password combination is not valid, a 403 code will be returned with body: `{error: 'auth'}`.
   - If the username/password combination is valid but the email hasn't been verified yet, a 403 code will be returned with body `{error: 'verify'}`.
   - `tz` must be the output of `Date.getTimezoneOffset ()`, an integer expressing the number of minutes behind (or ahead) of UTC in the local time.

- `POST /auth/signup`.
   - Does not require the user to be logged in.
   - Body must be `{username: STRING, password: STRING, email: STRING, token: STRING}`. The email must be a valid email. If not, a 400 code will be returned with body `{error: ...}`.
   - Both `username` and `email` are lowercased and leading & trailing space is removed from them (and intermediate spaces or space-like characters are reduced to a single space). `username` cannot contain any `@` or `:` characters.
   - If there's no invite associated with the token, a 403 is returned with body `{error: 'token'}`.
   - If there's already an account with that email, a 403 is returned with body `{error: 'email'}`.
   - If there's already an account with that username, a 403 is returned with body `{error: 'username'}`.

- `GET /auth/verify/TOKEN` (for verifying email ownership).

   - If successful, it sends an email to the associated email address with a link for password recovery.

- `GET /auth/logout`.
   - Unless there's an error, the route will return a 302 code with the `location` header set to `/`.

- `POST /auth/delete`.
   - Temporarily disabled (route always returns 501).
   - User must be logged in, otherwise a 403 is returned.
   - The body is ignored.

- `POST /tag`
   - Body must be of the form `{tag: STRING, ids: [STRING, ...], del: true|false|undefined}`
   - `tag` will be trimmed (any whitespace at the beginning or end of the string will be eliminated; space-like characters in the middle will be replaced with a single space).

   - `body.from` and `body.to` must be positive integers, and `body.to` must be equal or larger to `body.from`. For a given query, they provide pagination capability. Both are indexes (starting at 1) that specify the first and the last picture to be returned from a certain query. If both are equal to 1, the first picture for the query will be returned. If they are 1 & 10 respectively, the first ten pictures for the query will be returned.
   - `all` cannot be included on `body.tags`. If you want to search for all available pictures, set `body.tags` to an empty array. If you send this tag, you'll get a 400 with body `{error: 'all'}`.
   - If defined, `body.mindate` & `body.maxdate` must be UTC dates in milliseconds.
   - `body.sort` determines whether sorting is done by `newest`, `oldest`, or `upload`. The first two criteria use the *earliest* date that can be retrieved from the metadata of the picture, or the `lastModified` field. In the case of the `upload`, the sorting is by *newest* upload date; there's no option to sort by oldest upload.
   - If the query is successful, a 200 is returned with body `pics: [{...}], total: INT}`.
      - Each element within `body.pics` is an object corresponding to a picture and contains these fields: `{date: INT, dateup: INT, id: STRING, t200: STRING|UNDEFINED, t900: STRING|UNDEFINED, owner: STRING, name: STRING, dimh: INT, dimw: INT, tags: [STRING, ...], deg: INT|UNDEFINED}`.
      - `body.total` contains the number of total pictures matched by the query (notice it can be larger than the amount of pictures in `body.pics`).

`POST /share`
   - Body must be of the form `{tag: STRING, who: ID, del: BOOLEAN|UNDEFINED}`.
   - The target user (`body.who`) must exist, otherwise a 404 is returned.
   - If the tag being shared is `all` or `untagged`, a 400 is returned with body `{error: 'tag'}`.
   - If try to share with yourself, a 400 is returned with body `{error: 'self'}`.
   - If successful, returns a 200.

`GET /share`
   - If successful, returns a 200 with body `{sho: [[USERNAME1, TAG1], ...], shm: [[USERNAME2, TAG2], ...]}`.
   - `body.sho` lists the tags shared with others by the user. `body.shm` lists the tags shared with the user.

`GET /account`
   - If successful, returns a 200 with body `{username: STRING, email: STRING, type: STRING, created: INTEGER, used: [INTEGER_USED, INTEGER_MAXIMUM], logs: [...]}`.

## Features

## Client Data/State structure

`State.view`: can be `'auth'` or `'main'`.

`State.subview`: for view `'auth'`:  `'login'`/`'signup'`. For view `'main'`, `'browse'`/`'upload'`.

`State.notify`: for printing messages, `{color: STRING, message: STRING, timeout: TIMEOUT FOR CLEARING State.notify}`.

`State.query`: `{tags: [...], sort: 'newest'/'oldest'/'upload'}`.

`State.shift`: `true|false|undefined`, truthy when the `shift` key is depressed.

`State.ctrl`: `true|false|undefined`, truthy when the `ctrl` key is depressed.

`State.autotag`: STRING denoting the tag being entered by the user for tagging pictures or searching for an existing tag with which to tag pictures.

`State.refreshQuery`: `undefined|timeout`. If there are pending uploads in `State.upload.queue`, this timeout retrieves pics. It's executed once per second.

`State.autoquery`: `undefined|string`, used to search for tags in the query box.

`State.upload`: used for queuing uploads `{queue: [FILE1, FILE2, ...], error: [[error, file], ...], invalid: [filename, ...], done: INT, repeated: INT, tags: [...]}`.

`State.uploadFolder`: `undefined|boolean`. If `true`, the input for uploading files will upload entire directories instead.

`State.uploadModal`: `undefined|true`, if true, show the upload modal.

`State.lastClick`: `undefined|{id: PICID, time: INT}`, marks the last picture clicked and the time when it happened, to implement the folllowing: picture selection, picture selection by range, opening canvas view.

`State.lastScroll`: `undefined|{y: INT, time: INT}`, marks the time of the last scroll, and the last Y position of the window (`window.scrollY`).

`State.canvas`: `undefined|PIC`, if not undefined contains the picture object that's being shown on the `canvas` view.

`State.nextCanvas`: `undefined|PIC`, used to preload the next picture in the `canvas` view.

`State.showPictureInfo`: `undefined|boolean`, if truthy, picture information is shown on the `canvas` view.

`State.screen`: `{w: window.innerWidth, h: window.innerHeight}`. Used by the `canvas` view.

`State.selected`: `{id1: true, id2: true, ...}`. Lists the ids all of selected pictures.

`State.slider`: true|false|undeined. If no pictures selected, falsy is all tags, truthy is selected tags. If pictures are selected, falsy is add tags, truthy is remove tags.

`State.loading`: true|undefined, to see whether pics are being loaded.

`Data.pics`: `[...]`; comes from `body.pics` from `POST /query`. A `selected` boolean can be added by the client to denote selection of the picture, but that never reaches the server.

`Data.total`: number of pics matched by query. Also comes from `POST /query`.

`Data.tags`: `{all: INT, untagged: INT, ...}`; the body returned by `GET /tags`.

`Data.account`: `{username: STRING, email: STRING, type: STRING, created: INT, logs: [{...}, ...], used: [INT, INT]`; the body returned by `GET /account`.

## Configuration

On `/etc/security/limits.conf`, the following two lines to increase file handles per process:

```
* soft nofile 99999
* hard nofile 99999
```

On `/etc/sysctl.conf`:

```
# increases TCP maximum queue length to 4096
net.core.somaxconn=4096
# for giving more memory to redis to create background processes for saving the DB to disk
vm.overcommit_memory=1
```

`start.sh` (must be executable, set with `chmod 777 start.sh`):

```
export PATH="/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/bin:/snap/bin"
echo never > /sys/kernel/mm/transparent_hugepage/enabled
service redis-server restart
cd /root/acpic && mg restart
```

crontab with `@reboot /root/start.sh`

### HTTPS configuration

Installation of certbot:

```
sudo add-apt-repository ppa:certbot/certbot -y
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install python-certbot-nginx -y
```

On your relevant nginx configuration (either at `/etc/nginx/sites-available` or `/etc/nginx/sites-enabled`), add this line:

```
   server_name YOURDOMAIN
```

Make sure your domain points to the server where you're adding these changes. Then run these commands:

```
service nginx reload
sudo certbot --nginx -d YOURDOMAIN
```

Add the following to your crontab, to renew the certificates at the hour HH:YY every day.

```
crontab: YY HH * * * sudo certbot renew
```
